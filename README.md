# 🧠 Suicidal Text Detection – AI for Mental Health Monitoring  

## 🚀 Overview  
This **Machine Learning model** is designed to analyze text from social media platforms like **Reddit, Facebook, and Instagram** and predict whether a caption, title, or any text indicates suicidal intent. The goal is to aid in early detection and intervention by leveraging **Deep Natural Language Processing (DNLP)** techniques.  

## ✨ Features  
- 🔹 **Social Media Text Analysis:** Reads posts, captions, and comments to assess suicidal risk.  
- 🔹 **Multi-Platform Support:** Works with text from **Reddit, Facebook, and Instagram**.  
- 🔹 **Deep NLP Processing:** Implements advanced **DNLP** techniques for text understanding.  
- 🔹 **High Accuracy Predictions:** Achieves optimal results using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**.  
- 🔹 **Early Intervention:** Can assist mental health professionals by flagging concerning content.  

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Text Extraction** – Collects text data from social media platforms.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Cleans and tokenizes text for NLP analysis.  
3. **Model Inference** – Uses **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)** to classify text as suicidal or non-suicidal.  
4. **Prediction Output** – Flags high-risk content for further review.  

## 📚 Use Cases  
- ✅ **Mental Health Monitoring:** Helps identify individuals at risk based on their social media activity.  
- ✅ **Content Moderation:** Can assist platforms in filtering harmful posts.  
- ✅ **Research & Analysis:** Useful for studying social media trends related to mental health.
